### Hi there 👋

- :whale: I’m Nelson Cheung, a Junior Student at Sun-Yat Sen University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Compiler, Operating System……
- :eyes: I’m working as a TA in the 2021 spring operating system course of Sun Yat-Sen University, taking the responsibility for writing the tutorial and Q&A.
- 🤔 The most things I’m proud of are my 32-bit protect mode toy operating system named NeXon and a tutorial for NeXon named “OS Lab: A Freshman’s Perspective”.
- :sweat_smile: You will never see any public repositories relative to my course project tasks, because they are too simple and stupid to be public.
- 📫 If you have any question or comments, please email me at zhangjunyu@nelson-cheung.cn
